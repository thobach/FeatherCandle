# FeatherCandle
Animated candle using Adafruit Feather and Adafruit CharliePlex FeatherWing 15x7 LED array

Clone of [wbphelps/FeatherCandle](https://github.com/wbphelps/FeatherCandle) which is based on Adafruit/FirePendant, modified for the Feather. Loops a canned animation sequence on two displays.

Arduino sketch is comprised of 'FeatherCandle.ino' and 'data7x15.h' -- latter contains animation frames packed into PROGMEM array holding bounding rectangle + column-major pixel data for each frame (consumes most of the flash space on the ATmega328).

The 'frames.zip' archive contains the animation source PNG images and a python script, convert.py, which processes all the source images into the required data.h format. The PNG images were generated via Adobe Premiere and Photoshop from [Free Stock Video by user 'dietolog' on Videezy.com](https://www.videezy.com/fire-and-smoke/788-candle-light-stock-video).
